# 1 # Towards the design of fusogenic nanoparticle
#####

Idea:
Liposomes fuse via a fusion pore 
- show how decreased hydrophobic interaction and/or increased hydrophobic interaction fluctuations make it more likely for fusion pore to occur

Simulations:
Design nanoparticle by size, prolateness, strength of nanoparticle-liposome interation for best fusion properties
- meaning the best in creating properties/structures that promote the formation of fusion pore

Analysis:
Alternative 1:
In each frame from trajectory calculate hydrophobic energy per lipid tail particle
- scale this value by the average hydrophobic energy in flat membrane - we want values in range (1,0)
-- differentiate between bead position in lipid molecule - head-tail_1-tail_2
- then convert the relevant part of xtc trajectory to pdb file trajectory
-- the hydrophobic energy info will be written in beta factor column and used as color in vmd
Pros: Easy to implement
Cons: Splits the membrane into 4 layers
- better if it is just 1 or 1 per leaflet layer
- but maybe it will be necessary to do it in 4 layers depending on results

Alternative 2:
- bin the membrane - by size of hydrophobic interaction cutoff, maybe more due to curve membrane
-- curved membrane will complicate stuff - will require calculating with "wedges"
- assign hydrophobic cumulative energy of each lipid particle within bin
-- consider pairs of particles instead of single particles
--- if each particle is in different bin, contribute to each with only half
Pros: Simpler figure
Cons: difficult to implement
The change and fluctuation in hydrophobic energy may be small when averaged in such a way

This analyses will be done using in-house "ico" software. On my TODO list.

# 2 # Free energy of fusion paper
#####
Idea:
Estimate free energy barrier from formed stalk to fused state of liposomes

Simulations:
Few types of fusogenic nanoparticles, few diameters of fusing liposomes

Analysis:
Non-equilibrium process, the time to fuse will have exponential distribution. 
- Need at least 9 simulations for 20% error in estimation of half-life
- analyze the time from first hydrophobic membrane core contact to fully fused state

### I already have done something similar and will provide the analysis scripts

# 3 # Nanoparticle cooperation OR Chain of nanoparticles in fusion
#####
Idea:
Promote fusion via diaphragm rupture by enlarging stalk. Using either 3? nanoparticles or a chain with a set persistence length

Simulation:
Varied nanoparticle size, prolateness, interaction strength and persistence length
- maybe liposome diameter

Analysis same as #2#

#####
# 4 # Fusion pathway - fusion pore or diaphragm rupture
#####
# OR incorporate into previous papers
#####
Idea:
The nanoparticle actually hinders fusion via diaphragm rupture. Fusion usually via a fusion pore pathway.
- from simulation of paper #1# do we see diapgragm rupture?
- Addition to paper #2#: gradually decrease liposome-nanoparticle interaction while in stalk formation.
-- How will it affect fusion time? Estimate free energy barrier if possible
